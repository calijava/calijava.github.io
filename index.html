		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/I-5-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="I"/>
			n Unit 2, I have learned how to use simple HTML skills that is the start of me learning more in my Web Design class. I had already learned simple HTML. In this unit I have learned about what HTML Markup is, different kinds of lists, how to link different things into my HTML, making tables, and putting a video into one of my pages. I will use the different things that I have learned to improve the way that I code and create more future websites. The way that I had created this paragraph and unordered list was from Unit 2.</p> 

			<p>I am also going to make an unordred OR ordered list right here under the paragraphs, listing the things I found particularly informative in this unit.</p>

				<div class="learned">
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to create different kinds of lists.</li>
						<li>Creating a navigation that can work and go to different pages I have been working on.</li>
						<li>Having the opprotunity to work with my Guild members to create a video for a PSA Contest.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
	
		<h2>Unit 3</h2>
			<p>Through this 3rd Unit that we have started. In this unit, we began to learn basic skills for CSS. I learned the basic code that will be happing me design more onto my page. Some of the most useful things that I have been learning is how to change the colors for everything on my page, how to change all of the different effects for fonts, I discovered how to put box models into my CSS, I finally learned what the role of ID and Class in CSS is, and several page layout techniques. </p>

				<div class="learned">
					<ul>
						<li>I have began to start my CSS, and including things.</li>
						<li>I learned many different tools that will change how my Web Portfolio will be looking.</li>
						<li></li>
					</ul>

		<h2>Unit 4
			<a href="graphics.html">
				<img src="_assets/images/b_camera.png" width="72" height="72" style="border:none"
					alt="Camera"/>
			</a>
		</h2>
			<p>Unit 4 has taught me many different skills about the different types of Web Graphics to include in my page. We had first began by understanding what the purpose of using Web Graphics are, and how they are important to a website. Then, we had chosen images that we had cropped, resized, and included into our Graphics Page. Next, we created two buttons that have been put onto the page. The first button allows the viewer to click on the ‘Mail’ symbol to send emails, and the second button is a ‘Camera’ symbol. We also designed personal favicons that. Lastly, I had created a Web Page Banner that will be the first the the viewer sees. I decided to use the Las Vegas skyline for my banner. </p>

				<div class="learned">
					<ul>
						<li>I learned the different ways to add images onto a page.</li>
						<li>Creating thumbnails that lead to the full image.</li>
						<li>How a banner completely changes how a website looks.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
	
		<h2>Unit 5</h2>
			<p>During this unit, I have learned different techniques for scripting on the web and different JavaScript skills. First, we learned how you can create an alert that will pop up on the webpage.  Next, we practiced finding different errors that may come up on a page using JavaScript, and how to fix those problems. Lastly, we created a working clock that shows the current time in seconds. We also created our own custom video player buttons. It allows the user to fast foward, slow down, press play and pause, and change the volume.</p>

				<div class="learned">
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to create a working current working clock.</li>
						<li>How buttons can create alerts to go off.</li>
						<li>Creating a control panel for video watching.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
	
		<h2>Unit 6</h2>
			<p>This Unit was focused around Validating our Website. It’s very important to have a website that does not have multiple errors, and by using a Validator, it allows me to see what is wrong. We had also conducted a survey to see if our webpages functions worked correctly. The survey worked very well, and I most likely do another survey when I need more feedback on my webpage.</p>

				<div class="learned">
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to create a Google Form.</li>
						<li>The purpose of conducting a survey.</li>
						<li>How to Validate my website correctly.</li>
				</div>
